    Extract a spotify feature vector from LM output by providing demonstration data
    
    1. Pulls the users top artists in specified range
    2. Extract audio features for the top songs of each artist
    3. Average features for each artist and get their genres
    4. Create a dataframe with the features and genres
    5. Save the dataframe to csv

    1. Load the csv to the LM
    2. Feed the LM a prompt with the desired description
    3. The LM will output genres and a feature vector
    4. Features and genres sent to SP
